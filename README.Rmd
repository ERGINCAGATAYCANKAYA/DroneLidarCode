# DroneLidarCode

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

DroneLidarCode is a repository to share analysis and processing code related to the T3 Upland Silviculture Study. The T3 study is taking place on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state. The study is a joint effort of the Washington Department of Natural Resources (WADNR) and the University of Washington's Olympic Natural Resources Center (ONRC).

Lidar data was collected from a UAS platform in the summers of 2021 and 2022 over specific study areas. In addition, field measurements on plots within the study areas were also collected. The data are high density (over 800 pulses per square meter) and provide highly detailed information about the upper- and mid-canopy vegetation. The point cloud data is not available in the repository but is accessible on a shared drive and available to project collaborators. Samples of the data for specific field plots are available [here](http://forsys.sefs.uw.edu/transfer/T3Plots/). This [document](extras/T3_drone_lidar_plots.pdf) has some instructions for using the plot data in FUSION to visualize the point cloud and measured trees.

This repository contains the field data and analysis code used to develop useful products from the lidar data and to explore some specific research topics such as distinguishing Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) from western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) using upper crown morphology and intensity values.

While not specifically intended for broad distribution, the code is available in this public repository for all to enjoy!!

## Field data

The field data consists of a single excel spreadsheet with all of the measured trees and a shapefile with the plot center locations. Locations were collected using a Javad Triumph 2 GNSS receiver and post processed using a nearby base station. With the receiver, we expect locations within 1-2m of the true location. However, larger errors are possible given the dense canopy conditions and steep slopes. The following files are available:
  * [Field plot locations](extras/plot_centers_UTM.zip)
  * [T3 treatment units](extras/Units_UTM10.zip)
  * [Tree data](2021_T3_Upland+Trees.xlsx)
  
## Installation

There is no formal install process related to this code. However, you can simply clone the repository to your local computer. The easiest way to 
do this is to click the button labeled "<> Code" on the repository home page. Then click "download ZIP". Once on your local computer, you
can unzip the repository into a folder of your choosing.
