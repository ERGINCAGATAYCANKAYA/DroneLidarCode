DroneLidarCode is a repository to share analysis and processing code
related to the T3 Upland Silviculture Study. The T3 study is taking
place on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state. The study is a joint
effort of the Washington Department of Natural Resources (WADNR) and the
University of Washingtonâ€™s Olympic Natural Resources Center (ONRC).

Lidar data was collected from a UAS platform in the summers of 2021 and
2022 over specific study areas along with field measurements on plots
within the study areas.

This repository contains the field data and analysis code used to
develop useful products from the lidar data and to explore some specific
research topics such as distinguishing Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
menziesii) from western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla).

While not specifically intended for broad distribution, the code is
available in this public repository for all to enjoy!!

To install this code, simply cone the repository to your local computer.
